        <h2 class="post-section-title">Introduction</h2>
        <p>When we browse the internet, we interact with something called HTML. HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is like the blueprint of the internet. It's the basic language used to create web pages.</p>

      <section class="post-section">
        <h2 class="post-section-title">What is HTML?</h2>
        <p>HTML is a language made up of simple instructions, known as tags. These tags are like labels that tell web browsers how to display different parts of a webpage. For example, there's a tag for paragraphs, one for images, and one for links.

          HTML has a basic structure. It starts with an opening tag and ends with a closing tag. Inside these tags, there are two main sections: the part that contains information about the webpage, and the part that contains the main content like text and images.</p>
      </section>

        <h2 class="post-section-title">Why HTML matters?</h2>
        <p>HTML is important because it's the language that all web browsers understand. This means no matter what device or browser you're using, HTML ensures that websites look the same and work properly.

          Another reason HTML is important is because it helps make websites accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities. By using specific tags, developers can make sure websites are easy to understand and navigate for everyone.</p>

        <h2 class="post-section-title">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In simple terms, HTML is the language that makes websites work. It's like the foundation of a house - without it, everything would fall apart. By understanding HTML, we can better understand how the internet works and create websites that everyone can use and enjoy.
